Repository Description:

This repository provides a proof-of-concept implementation of the pipeline proposed in the paper "From Elicitation to Management: A Comprehensive Pipeline for Requirements Engineering with Foundation Models". The pipeline leverages foundation models, such as large language models and code generators, to support all phases of Requirements Engineering (RE), including elicitation, analysis, documentation, validation, and management.

Contents:
    Prompts: This repository includes example prompts used in the paper to demonstrate how foundation models can be fine-tuned and prompted to perform various RE tasks, such as:
    + Elicitation: generating interview questions, identifying stakeholders, and extracting requirements from natural language text.
    + Analysis: identifying ambiguities, inconsistencies, and incompleteness in requirements, and suggesting alternative formulations.
    + Documentation: generating requirement specifications, use cases, and user stories.
    + Validation: checking requirements for consistency, completeness, and feasibility.
    + Management: prioritizing requirements, identifying dependencies, and generating release plans.
    Results: This repository also includes some illustrative results of the pipeline, showcasing the output of the foundation models for each RE phase. These results demonstrate the potential of foundation models to support and augment human capabilities in RE.

Note: This repository is intended to provide a starting point for further research and development, rather than a production-ready implementation. The prompts and results provided are meant to inspire and guide future work in this area.
